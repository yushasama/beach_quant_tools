# big_quant_tools

## Overview

`big_quant_tools` is a comprehensive toolkit for quantitative financial analysis, developed for the Beach Investment Group at the California State University of Long Beach. This repository is currently in progress 
and aims to implement tools for risk metric computations, retrieval of market data from Yahoo Finance and Bloomberg, as well as machine learning.

Currently, `big_quant_tools` is in its development stage and thus it is not fully functional. Some components, including the `main.py` file, are placeholders and do not provide any interactive functionality at this time.
